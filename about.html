<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is DJ Smith and I am on a journey to becoming a successful software <br /> developer.
  Of course, this is just a portfolio of mine in the making and I will continuously <br />
  update every project as I build them. I've had to fight just to be here today and surely this <br /> 
  page will make that make sense.</p>

<h3>Why Software Development?</h3>

<p>I fell in love with IT in general when I landed a job at an IT facility scanning cable boxes for $17/hr. <br /> 
   I was then moved to the networking department because of my superiors liked my work ethic. I <br />
  did very excellent there working on network devices by navigating through the files and erasing <br />
configurations that were <strong>NOT</strong> suppose to be present. Then, I got into web development and I then <br />
 realized this is what I want to do for my career. Now, my focus is on web development, learning <br />
Python, and I also still have a strong interest in network administration. </p>
